# Technologies used:</br>
React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, CSS (Bootstrap), Sequelize ORM, bcrypt, Amazon S3, Surge and Heroku for hosting
<br>

# Backend approach:
I leveraged Heorku for hosting with Postgresql add-on and have 4 node.js route/controller pairs acting as APIs for the application frontend. Full CRUD was integrated for all items.
<br>

# Controllers:
- auth
- users
- characters
- images

#Code snippets:
bcrypt utilization
```javascript

const signup = (req, res) => {
	bcrypt.genSalt(10, (err, salt) => {
		if (err) {
			res.status(constants.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).send(`ERROR: ${err}`);
		}
		bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, salt, (err, hashedPwd) => {
			if (err) {
				res.status(constants.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).send(`ERROR: ${err}`);
			}
			req.body.password = hashedPwd;
			User.create(req.body);
			res
				.status(constants.SUCCESS)
				.json({
					user: req.body.username,
				})
		});
	});
};
```

# Known issues:
- None at this time

# What's left:
- Possible implementation of JSOn Web Tokens
- Realignment of functions to appropriate controllers
